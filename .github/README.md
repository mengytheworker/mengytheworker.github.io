# Graphic Pulsar Catalogue

The Graphic Pulsar Catalogue is a public welfare project. It aims at propagating pulsar astronomy to the public. So it has been designed to be at the midpoint between the professionals and the public. In the first release (v0.1.0), 3,319 pulsars are included, with 166 pulsars' radio pulse profiles collected. The presented parameters include the right ascension, declination under the J2000 equitorial coordinate system, pulsars' pulse period, dispersion measure (dm), proper motion in right ascension and proper motion in declination. All the information is taken from the academic literature.

The map under the J2000 equitorial coordinate system is drawn with the Gall-Peters projection. This projection stretches the equator and squeeze the poles, so areas where pulsars are dense are stretched while areas where pulsars are sparse are squeezed. Circle color indicates pulsar period; blue for less than ten milliseconds, black for otherwise. Circle size indicates DM value by being proportional to the value's natural logarithm. Where DM value is not available, a constant size is used. For those pulsars having proper motion measurements, a line is drawn from the pulsar. Line direction indicates proper motion direction and line length is two times square root of the proper motion amplitude; the amplitude is the quadrature sum of the proper motion value in the right ascension and the proper motion value in the declination.

You may pan or zoom in/out the map. You use mouse wheel to pan and use ctrl key plus mouse wheel to zoom in/out. If your computer has touch pad, then you move two fingers to pan and pinch to zoom in/out. If you are on a mobile device, then you move one finger to pan and pinch to zoom in/out. When you click or tap a pulsar, the pulsar's information is shown with a five-second animation. The animation of the pulse profile mimics the integration during an observation. For every parameter, a color bar shows its distribution; darker color indicates more counts. The distributions of pulse period and DM are in base-10 logarithm scale. The final position of the running pin indicates the position of the parameter value in the distribution.

You may also input a pulsar J-name and hit Search to check the pulsar.
